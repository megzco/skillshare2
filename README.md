** Designer's Log: Day 10  **

Skillshare2 is a repo housing my second coding project: a simple responsive webpage.

It is a terribly ugly page as I just followed instructions for the course and used the assets provided.

Note to self: don't leave a project for 16 days when you're in the middle of a lesson. Things get gnarly when you pick it back up.

I've finished the second project in the Skillshare course but I'm not super confident I executed everything as expected. The menu looks weird on the mobile scale but the instructor's level of taste in visual design leaves much to be desired... so I may have done it correctly. I'll go back and check at a later time.

I also, somehow, managed to have commit conflicts. BAH! This is what I get for not working on this stuff for a couple weeks. I think I forgot to merge after I pulled from github (last updates were done on a different machine). I snagged my most recent CSS before merging, merged up, then pasted new CSS in and re-committed and I think I'm okay now. But git is very foreign still. Eventually, this stuff will become more intuitive (I hope).

Next up: using the bootstrap framework! I'm excited for that.
